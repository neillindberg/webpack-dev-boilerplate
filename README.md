# webpack-dev-boilerplate
Boilerplate - NodeJS/Webpack: React, CSS, Hot Reloading (dir structure to change in src/)

As of August 2019 this is a boilerplate using all the newest webpack and babel loaders.
This supports: React with ES6 and arrow functions within components.
There is a small project that will be separated after forking this into its own project (for a memory game ad-free for my kids or whoever).

But, anyway, I'd tried several packages and they seemed too stuck to usign Expo, and maybe just too developed to understand everything that was going on with transpiling and such.

IN the end, this is a lightweight, ready to run, hot-reloading, good kick-off point for a nice dev experience on new React projects.

Things I'll add after forking:
- LESS support
- src/ directories: js, jsx, stlyes, images.
