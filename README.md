# webpack-dev-boilerplate
Boilerplate - NodeJS/Webpack: React, SASS-CSS, Hot Reloading (and simple dir structure).

As of August 2019 this is a boilerplate using all the newest webpack and babel loaders for the listed tech.
This supports: React with ES6 and arrow functions within components.
There is a small project that will be separated after forking this into its own project (for a memory game ad-free for my kids or whoever).
