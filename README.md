# webpack-dev-boilerplate
Boilerplate - NodeJS/Webpack: React, SASS-CSS, Hot Reloading (and simple dir structure).

As of August 2019 this is a boilerplate using all the newest webpack and babel loaders for the listed tech.
This supports: React with ES6 and arrow functions within components.
There is a small project that will be separated after forking this into its own project (for a memory game ad-free for my kids or whoever).

But, anyway, I'd tried several packages and they seemed to have too complex a fs for my initial needs, and maybe just too developed to understand everything that was going on with transpiling settings and such.

In the end, this is a lightweight, ready to run, hot-reloading, good kick-off point (functional, not too tied down) for a nice dev experience on new React projects.

- compiles to ./dist/ (git ignored)
- run a build for active development on *localhost:3000* with: `npm run start`
- see package.json scripts for all available options

Maybe?
    - jest... or mocha... or maybe just lint and move on? (too much?)
    - CucumberJS (too much?)
